		<h2> <span>Missile Man </span>of India</h2>
		<br><br>
		<p><strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong>(/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) 
			was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, 
			Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, 
			mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately 
			involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the 'Missile Man 
			of India' for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal 
			organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test 
			by India in 1974.[5]</p>

			<h1>Early Life</h1>
			<br><br>
			<p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of 
				Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen 
				Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father 
				owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam 
				was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders 
				and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, 
				the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim 
				ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had 
				involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between 
				the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family's meager income. With the opening 
				of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over 
				time, apart from the ancestral home.[19][20][21]<br>
				In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to 
				learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.[21] After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary 
				School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of 
				Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22] He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras 
				Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of 
				progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the 
				deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".
				[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were
				 available in the IAF.[24]

			<br><br>
			<p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the 
				Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, 
				but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[84] At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, 
				he collapsed.[85][86] He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse 
				or any other signs of life.[85] Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac 
				arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.[85][87][88] His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing 
				well?"[89]
